* (TEST 2) digits_all_1e2.txt 10 Valgrind
COMMENTS:
Check that there are no problems identified by Valgrind on a small run.

** program: ./kmeans_serial sample-mnist-data/digits_all_1e2.txt 10 test-results/outdir2 500
To run this individual test in GDB use the command:
  gdb --args ./kmeans_serial sample-mnist-data/digits_all_1e2.txt 10 test-results/outdir2 500
but any input to the program must be typed within the debugger

** --- Failure messages --- 
- FAILURE(139) due to SIGSEGV (segmentation fault) from OS
- FAILURE: Valgrind reports reachable memory, may need to add free() or fclose()

==10429==  If you believe this happened as a result of a stack
==10429==  overflow in your program's main thread (unlikely but
==10429==  possible), you can try to increase the size of the
==10429==  main thread stack using the --main-stacksize= flag.
==10429==  The main thread stack size used in this run was 8388608.
